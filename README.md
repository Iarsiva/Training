# Training
This is my repository to store my codes during my training.

I follow the course of Angela Yu on udemy: 100 days of python.
I like the course for the most parts so I decided to follow it at least until I get upper intermediate.
Mostly I try to do everything before the solutions and hints, I follow the solutions afterwards.
That way I learn to think like programmer but I still have a chance to improve and get a feedback of why I did what I did.
I want to move towards data science, mostly image processing.
